Pure Go/ASM implementation of CryptoNight hash function and some of its variant, without any CGO binding.

== Features
* Support Monero v7 variant, and also the upcoming https://github.com/monero-project/monero/pull/4218/[variant 2]!
* No CGO hell, making builds easier and faster.
* Hardware acceleration available for amd64 architecture.
* Use of an internal sync.Pool to manage caches, since it is memory hard.

== Install
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u ekyu.moe/cryptonight
----

A simple CLI utility is also available with `go get -u ekyu.moe/cryptonight/cmd/cnhash`.

[source,plain]
----
Usage of cnhash:
  -in-file string
        Read input from file instead of stdin.
  -in-hex
        Read input in hex instead of binary.
  -include-diff
        Append the difficulty of the result hash to the output. If -out-binary is not given,
the difficulty will be appeneded to the output in decimal with comma separated (CSV friendly),
otherwise it will be appeneded to the hash binary (which is 32 bytes long) directly, in 8 bytes
little endian.
  -out-binary
        Produce output in binary (little endian) instead of hex.
  -out-file string
        Produce output to file instead of stdout.
  -variant int
        Set CryptoNight variant, default 0.
----

== Example
[source,go]
----
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "ekyu.moe/cryptonight"
)

func main() {
    original := []byte("Hello, 世界")
    fmt.Printf("%x\n", cryptonight.Sum(original, 0)) // original
    // Output: 0999794e4e20d86e6a81b54495aeb370b6a9ae795fb5af4f778afaf07c0b2e0e

    variant_v1 := []byte("variant 1 requires at least 43 bytes of input.")
    fmt.Printf("%x\n", cryptonight.Sum(variant_v1, 1)) // variant 1
    // Output: 261124c5a6dca5d4aa3667d328a94ead9a819ae714e1f1dc113ceeb14f1ecf99

    variant_v2 := []byte("Monero is cash for a connected world. It’s fast, private, and secure.")
    fmt.Printf("%x\n", cryptonight.Sum(variant_v2, 2)) // variant 2
    // Output: c163d3839d69259d59b7f9b9a09dc043c3b11e34986c2a783091dbdcebed19f9

== Development
While this repository is already out-of-box, which means what you need to do to use it in your code is just a `go get` (or `dep ensure -add` whatsoever), in case you want to hack on this library, some additional steps are required since it uses code generation.

=== Preprocess
If you modified a source file in this library that uses C-kind macros (the comments tells), in order to expand them and generate the final code, https://linux.die.net/man/1/cpp[cpp(1)] is needed, which a part of GCC toolchain and should be already available if you have installed gcc (or MinGW for Windows) in your machine.

Once some modification is made in a file that used macro, simply use `go generate ekyu.moe/cryptonight/\...` to run the gcc preprocessor on them.

=== Packages information
``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/internal/aes``:: From Go's crypto/aes. Since CryptoNight's use of AES is quite non-standard and not intended for encryption, you must use this package this package with care for project that's not CryptoNight associated.

``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/internal/sha3``:: From Go's golang.org/x/crypto/sha3. All CryptoNight specific additional works are made in `cn.go` only; other files are untouched at all.

``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/groestl``:: Grøstl-256 implementation. It is directly ported from C and not quite optimized.

``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/jh``:: JH-256 implementation. It is directly ported from C and not quite optimized.

=== Tests, coverage and benchmarks
[source,shell]
----
$ go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.txt
$ go test -v -run=^$ -bench=. -benchmem
----

=== TODO
* [ ] ARM64-specific optimization
* [x] Tests on other architectures
* [x] Improve performance for variant 2
* [ ] Improve performance for groestl and jh
