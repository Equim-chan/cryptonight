Pure Go/ASM implementation of CryptoNight hash function and some of its variant, without any CGO binding.

== Features
* Support v0, v1, v2 variants.
* No CGO hell, making builds easier and faster.
* Hardware acceleration available for amd64 architecture.
* Use of an internal sync.Pool to manage caches, since it is memory hard.

== Install
[source,shell]
----
$ go get -u ekyu.moe/cryptonight
----

A simple CLI utility is also available with `go get -u ekyu.moe/cryptonight/cmd/cnhash`.

[source,plain]
----
Usage of cnhash:
  -bench
        Benchmark mode, don't do anything else.
  -in-file string
        Read input from file instead of stdin.
  -in-hex
        Read input in hex instead of binary.
  -include-diff
        Append the difficulty of the result hash to the output. If -out-binary is not given,
the difficulty will be appeneded to the output in decimal with comma separated (CSV friendly)
, otherwise it will be appeneded to the hash binary (which is 32 bytes long) directly, in 8
bytes little endian.
  -out-binary
        Produce output in binary (little endian) instead of hex.
  -out-file string
        Produce output to file instead of stdout.
  -variant int
        Set CryptoNight variant, default 0. This applies to benchmark mode as well.

== Example
[source,go]
----
package main

import (
    "fmt"

    "ekyu.moe/cryptonight"
)

func main() {
    blob := []byte("Hello, 世界")
    fmt.Printf("%x\n", cryptonight.Sum(blob, 0)) // original
    // Output: 0999794e4e20d86e6a81b54495aeb370b6a9ae795fb5af4f778afaf07c0b2e0e

    blob = []byte("variant 1 requires at least 43 bytes of input.")
    fmt.Printf("%x\n", cryptonight.Sum(blob, 1)) // variant 1
    // Output: 261124c5a6dca5d4aa3667d328a94ead9a819ae714e1f1dc113ceeb14f1ecf99

    blob = []byte("Monero is cash for a connected world. It’s fast, private, and secure.")
    fmt.Printf("%x\n", cryptonight.Sum(blob, 2)) // variant 2
    // Output: abb61f40468c70234051e4bb5e8b670812473b2a71e02c9633ef94996a621b96

== Development
While this repository is already out-of-box, which means what you need to do to use it in your code is just a `go get` (or `dep ensure -add` whatsoever), in case you want to hack on this library, some additional steps are required since it uses code generation.

=== Preprocess
If you modified a source file in this library that uses C-kind macros (the comments tells), in order to expand them and generate the final code, https://linux.die.net/man/1/cpp[cpp(1)] is needed, which a part of GCC toolchain and should be already available if you have installed gcc (or MinGW for Windows) in your machine.

Once some modification is made in a file that used macro, simply use `go generate ekyu.moe/cryptonight/\...` to run the gcc preprocessor on them.

=== Packages information
``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/internal/aes``:: From Go's crypto/aes. Since CryptoNight's use of AES is quite non-standard and not intended for encryption, you must use this package this package with care for project that's not CryptoNight associated.

``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/internal/sha3``:: From Go's golang.org/x/crypto/sha3. All CryptoNight specific additional works are made in `cn.go` only; other files are untouched at all.

``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/groestl``:: Grøstl-256 implementation. It is directly ported from C and not quite optimized.

``ekyu.moe/cryptonight/jh``:: JH-256 implementation. It is directly ported from C and not quite optimized.

=== Tests, coverage and benchmarks
[source,shell]
----
$ go test -v -race -coverprofile=coverage.txt -covermode=atomic
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.txt
$ go test -v -run=^$ -bench=. -benchmem
----

=== TODO
* [ ] ARM64-specific optimization
* [x] Tests on other architectures
* [x] Improve performance for variant 2
* [ ] Improve performance for groestl and jh
* [x] Try a nearly full assembly implementation (except for the final hash) for amd64
